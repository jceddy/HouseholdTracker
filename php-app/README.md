# php-app

Plain PHP REST API for HouseholdTracker, using PDO to talk to the MySQL
database defined in [`../database`](../database).

## Setup

```sh
composer install
cp .env.example .env   # then edit with your local MySQL credentials
```

Apply the database migrations (see [`../database`](../database) for
details):

```sh
composer migrate
```

then start the built-in dev server:

```sh
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/health` to verify the app can connect to the
database.

## Layout

- `public/` — Web server document root / front controller.
- `src/` — Application source (PSR-4 autoloaded under `HouseholdTracker\`).
  - `Auth/` — Registration, login, session, and password reset logic
    (`AuthService`) plus its exceptions.
  - `Repository/` — Thin PDO data-access classes, one per table.
  - `Database/` — `Connection` (a lazily-created PDO singleton) and
    `MigrationRunner`.
  - `Mail/` — `Mailer`, a thin PHPMailer/SMTP wrapper.
  - `Maintenance/` — `MaintenanceGate`, the deployed-`VERSION`-vs-
    `schema_version` check (see "Maintenance mode" below).
  - `Config.php` — Reads `.env` (falling back to real environment
    variables), the single source every other class reads settings from.
  - `SiteUrl.php` — Derives the static frontend's own domain root from
    `SITE_URL`/`APP_URL`.
- `bin/migrate.php` — Applies pending database migrations from
  `../database/migrations/` (see that project's README).
- `tests/` — PHPUnit tests.

## API

All responses are JSON with a `status` field (`ok` or `error`), except
`/verify-email` — that one's opened directly from an emailed link by a
human rather than called by our own JS, so it renders an HTML page
instead. Every route except `/health` and `/migrate` can also return `503`
with `{"status": "maintenance", "message"}` (or, for `/verify-email`, an
HTML maintenance page) — see "Maintenance mode" below.

| Method | Path                    | Body                                            | Notes |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| GET    | `/health`                | —                                                 | Checks DB connectivity. Exempt from maintenance mode. |
| POST   | `/migrate`                | —                                                 | Requires an `X-Migration-Key` header matching the `MIGRATION_DEPLOY_KEY` secret; `403` if missing/wrong or unconfigured. Applies pending `database/migrations/*.sql` files. Returns `{"applied": [string]}`. See `database/README.md`. |
| POST   | `/register`               | `{"username", "email", "password"}`               | Creates an unverified user and emails a verification link. Username: 3-32 chars (letters/numbers/`_`/`-`); email: valid format; password: 8-72 chars. `409` on duplicate username/email, `400` on validation failure, `502` if the verification email can't be sent (registration is rolled back so you can retry). |
| GET    | `/verify-email`           | query param `token`                               | HTML page (not JSON). On success, auto-redirects to `/` after 5 seconds. `400` with a link to `resend-verification.html` if the token is invalid/expired. |
| POST   | `/resend-verification`    | `{"email"}`                                       | Issues a fresh verification link and emails it. Always returns the same generic `200` regardless of account state, so it can't be used to discover which addresses are registered. Rate-limited to once per 60 seconds per account; `400` on invalid email, `502` if sending fails. |
| POST   | `/forgot-password`        | `{"email"}`                                       | Issues a password reset link (valid 1 hour) and emails it. Same enumeration-resistant `200` and rate limit as `/resend-verification`. The emailed link points at the static `reset-password.html` page, not a GET route — see "Password reset" below. |
| POST   | `/reset-password`         | `{"token", "password"}`                           | Consumes a single-use reset token and sets the new password (8-72 chars). Also deletes every one of the account's sessions. `400` if the token is invalid/expired/used or the password fails validation. |
| POST   | `/login`                  | `{"username", "password"}`                        | `401` on bad credentials, `403` if the email isn't verified yet. |
| POST   | `/logout`                 | —                                                  | Invalidates the current session only. |
| GET    | `/me`                     | —                                                  | Returns the current user if authenticated, `401` otherwise. |

Auth-requiring routes use the `session_token` cookie set by `/login`/`/me`
(`401` if missing/invalid) — see `requireAuth()` in `public/index.php`.
Whatever household-tracking domain routes come next belong below `/me` in
`public/index.php`, each guarded by the same `requireAuth($auth)` call.

## Maintenance mode

Every route except `/health`, `/migrate`, and `/verify-email` (which
checks the gate itself and renders an HTML maintenance page instead) is
preceded by a `MaintenanceGate::activeMessage()` check: if the deployed
`VERSION` file doesn't match the `schema_version` row in the database, the
request gets a `503` with `{"status": "maintenance", "message"}` instead
of running against a schema a migration hasn't been applied to yet. See
"Versioning" in the top-level README and "Adding a new migration" in
`database/README.md`.

## Password reset

`/forgot-password` emails a link to the *static* `reset-password.html`
page (not a GET API route) so that corporate email-security scanners that
pre-fetch links in inbound mail can't silently burn the single-use token
before the real user opens it — the token is only submitted (and
consumed) when the visitor actually chooses a new password, via
`POST /reset-password`. `/verify-email`, in contrast, safely consumes its
token on a bare GET, since a verification link being opened twice (once
by a scanner, once by the human) is harmless either way.
